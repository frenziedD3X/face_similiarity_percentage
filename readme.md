# Face Similarity Checker

This project is a Flask-based web application that calculates the similarity between faces in two uploaded images using the `face_recognition` library.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in uploaded images.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Computes the similarity percentage between the faces.
- **Web Interface**: Simple HTML-based UI for uploading images.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- face_recognition
- numpy

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/Face-Similarity-Checker.git
   cd Face-Similarity-Checker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

5. Use the UI to upload two images and compare their similarity.

## Integrating with JavaScript

To integrate the backend Flask application with a JavaScript-based frontend:

1. Use AJAX or Fetch API to send a POST request to the `/compare_faces` endpoint.

   Example using Fetch API:
   ```javascript
   const formData = new FormData();
   formData.append('image1', file1); // file1 is the first image file
   formData.append('image2', file2); // file2 is the second image file

   fetch('/compare_faces', {
       method: 'POST',
       body: formData
   })
   .then(response => response.json())
   .then(data => {
       console.log(data.similarity); // Output the similarity percentage
   })
   .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
   ```

2. Update the frontend HTML to include the necessary JavaScript.

---

## Integrating with PHP

To integrate the Flask backend with a PHP-based frontend:

1. Use `cURL` or a library like Guzzle in PHP to send the images as a POST request.

   Example using `cURL`:
   ```php
   <?php
   $url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/compare_faces";
   $file1 = new CURLFile('/path/to/image1.jpg');
   $file2 = new CURLFile('/path/to/image2.jpg');

   $data = array('image1' => $file1, 'image2' => $file2);

   $ch = curl_init();
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

   $response = curl_exec($ch);
   curl_close($ch);

   $result = json_decode($response, true);
   echo "Face Similarity: " . $result['similarity'];
   ?>
   ```

2. Ensure that the Flask server is running and accessible from your PHP environment.

---

## Notes
- The `face_recognition` library requires `dlib`, which might need additional system libraries. Refer to [face_recognition documentation](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) for platform-specific setup instructions.
- Ensure the Flask server URL is accessible from your JavaScript or PHP environment.
